# 🧠 Architecture Overview

## CI/CD Flow

Each service CI file runs the **full pipeline** as five sequential jobs:

```
push to develop / feature/** / release/** / hotfix/**
    ↓
[job: lint]   lint (warn-only, continue-on-error)
    ↓
[job: build]  compile / transpile / install deps
    ↓
[job: test]   run test suite    ← release and publish are skipped

PR opened or updated → main / develop / release/**
    ↓ same lint → build → test (release and publish skipped)

push to main (a merged PR produces this push)
    ↓ lint → build → test
    ↓
[job: release]  semantic-release → creates tag (e.g. go-v1.2.0)
    ↓ (only if new tag was created)
[job: publish]  docker build & push to GHCR
```

Release and publish run on a **push to `main`**. Merging a PR into `main` is what produces that push, so they effectively run on merge. semantic-release cannot run inside a `pull_request` event (it detects the PR and refuses to publish), so the release is driven by the `push` event instead. Enforce "no direct pushes to main" with GitHub **branch protection** (require a PR before merging).

# ⚙️ CI Workflows

Each service has its own self-contained pipeline:

| Service | Workflow | Jobs |
| ------- | -------- | ---- |
| Go      | `go-ci.yml`     | lint → build → test → release → publish |
| Node.js | `node-ci.yml`   | lint → build → test → release → publish |
| Python  | `python-ci.yml` | lint → build → test → release → publish |
| Rust    | `rust-ci.yml`   | lint → build → test → release → publish |

### Features

* ✅ Path-based triggers — fires on service files or its own workflow files
* ✅ Lint (warn-only, `continue-on-error: true`)
  - [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) (Go)
  - [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) (Node.js, requires `^20.19.0`, `^22.x`, or `>=24`)
  - [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) (Python)
  - [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) (Rust)
* ✅ Build + Test (blocking)
  - Go: `go build`, `go test`
  - Node.js: `npm run build` (Babel), [vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest)
  - Python: [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org)
  - Rust: `cargo build`, `cargo test`
* ✅ Release — semantic-release on `main` push, skipped on feature branches
* ✅ Publish — Docker image to GHCR, only when a new tag is created
* ✅ Dependency caching

---

# 🔁 Reusable Workflows

Each CI stage has its own dedicated reusable workflow file, located at the top level of `.github/workflows/` with a `reusable-` prefix:

| Stage | Files |
| ----- | ----- |
| Lint  | `reusable-go-lint.yml`, `reusable-node-lint.yml`, `reusable-python-lint.yml`, `reusable-rust-lint.yml` |
| Build | `reusable-go-build.yml`, `reusable-node-build.yml`, `reusable-python-build.yml`, `reusable-rust-build.yml` |
| Test  | `reusable-go-test.yml`, `reusable-node-test.yml`, `reusable-python-test.yml`, `reusable-rust-test.yml` |
| Release | `reusable-release.yml` (shared — accepts `service`, `releaserc`, `tag_pattern` inputs) |
| Publish | `reusable-publish.yml` (shared — accepts `service`, `version` inputs) |

> **Why top-level?** GitHub Actions only supports local `./` reusable workflow references at the top level of `.github/workflows/`. Subdirectories are not supported for local paths — they require the full `owner/repo/...@ref` format instead.

Benefits of per-stage reusable workflows:

* Each stage can be inspected, re-run, or replaced independently
* Release and publish logic is shared across all four services via `reusable-release.yml` and `reusable-publish.yml`
* Clear separation of concerns in the Actions UI (five distinct jobs per run)

# 🔍 YAML Linting

Workflow files are validated locally with [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint).

```sh
pip3 install yamllint
yamllint .github/workflows/
```

### Configuration — `.yamllint.yml`

GitHub Actions YAML has conventions that conflict with yamllint's defaults. The `.yamllint.yml` file at the repo root overrides three rules:

| Rule | Setting | Reason |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| `truthy` | `check-keys: false` | GitHub Actions requires the bare `on:` trigger key. YAML 1.1 parses it as boolean `true`, which yamllint flags. Quoting it as `"on":` breaks nothing but deviates from universal Actions convention — so key checking is disabled instead. |
| `document-start` | `disable` | `---` document start is optional in YAML and is not used in GitHub Actions files by convention. |
| `line-length` | `max: 120` | GitHub Actions expressions (`${{ secrets.TOKEN }}`) and Docker commands naturally exceed the 80-char default. 120 is a reasonable limit for CI YAML. |

# 🧪 Semantic Versioning (Per Service)

Each service is versioned independently using **semantic-release**.

## Tag Format

```
go-v1.0.0
node-v2.3.1
python-v0.5.0
rust-v3.0.0
```

---

## Commit Convention (Required)

Use **scoped conventional commits**:

```sh
feat(node): add authentication
fix(go): handle nil pointer
feat(python): add worker
```

### Version Rules

| Commit Type | Version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| `fix:`      | Patch   |
| `feat:`     | Minor   |
| `feat!:`    | Major   |

---

# 🐳 Docker Publishing

Triggered by per-service Git tags:

```
go-v*
node-v*
python-v*
rust-v*
```

## Image Naming

```
ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>/<service>:<version>
```

### Example

```
ghcr.io/your-org/monorepo/node:1.2.0
```

---

# 🔐 GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

No manual setup required.

### Authentication

Uses built-in:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN
```

### Required Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write
```

# ⚡ Performance Optimizations

* 🔹 Path-based CI triggers
* 🔹 Parallel workflows per service
* 🔹 Dependency caching
* 🔹 Docker layer optimization
* 🔹 Reusable workflows

# 🧩 Adding a New Service

1. Create `/<service>/` with source code, `Dockerfile`, and build/test config
2. Add a test file (`test_*.py`, `*.test.js`, etc.)
3. Add `reusable-<service>-lint.yml`, `reusable-<service>-build.yml`, `reusable-<service>-test.yml`
4. Add `.github/workflows/<service>-ci.yml` — call the three stage reusables, then call `reusable-release.yml` and `reusable-publish.yml` with the service-specific inputs
5. Create `.releaserc.<service>.json` with scoped release rules, a `{ "scope": "!(<service>)", "release": false }` veto (so commits from other scopes can't release this service), and `tagFormat: "<service>-v${version}"`
6. Add a new job with `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/<service>-v')` in `publish.yml`
